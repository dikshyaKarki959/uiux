                        Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in
                        South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic
                        Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south,
                        east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and
                        from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile
                        plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including
                        Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest
                        city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, and multi-cultural state, with
                        Nepali as the official language.

                        The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent,
                        the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In
                        the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in
                        Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet.
                        The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was
                        the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the
                        ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed
                        distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the
                        unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an
                        alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never
                        colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary
                        democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005.
                        The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular
                        republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.

                        The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a federal parliamentary
                        republic divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and
                        friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent
                        secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a
                        founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal
                        Initiative.</p>

                    <p>Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise origin
                        of the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back
                        as the fourth century AD.[16] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest
                        texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic
                        attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history
                        and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman
                        languages.[17]

                        According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne,
                        referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by
                        Ne, the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.[18][19][d] According to
                        Nepāl Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.[20] According
                        to Buddhist mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the
                        Nepal valley and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would
